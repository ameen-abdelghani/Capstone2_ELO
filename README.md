# Elo Customer Loyalty

## Problem Statement

Elo is one of the top credit and debit card companies in Brazil. Currently they are aiming to introduce a new perk to users that will give them discounts to merchants in their area. Currently all users are being given the same promotion no matter the difference in users. Elo is seeking to improve the system by recommending merchants that users will be interested in. 

The initial step to Elo’s goal is for them to better understand customer loyalty. This information can be used to create specific marketing campaigns aimed at unique customers. This custom tailored marketing should be far more effective than Elo’s current campaigns. Users will be more engaged with Elo and its services. Potentially ads can be tailored to unique market segments, based off the data, to increase ad-clicks and gain new clients.

## Data

The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation/data) is available on the kaggle competition page. There are 4 csv files of use for the analysis.
